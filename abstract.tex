This thesis explores the creation of a framework to unearth historical records with an emphasis on accelerating observations and visualizations from their data. The aim of this thesis is to contribute this framework to historians and scholars in the digital humanities community, where this is currently a untimely and cumbersome task. To achieve this goal, this thesis applies Natural Language Processing and Data Science. The paramount data for this work is derived from the African Californios project, where a collection of census data and historical texts are used as a basis for measuring this framework's performance. This data encompasses the lives of persons living in California during its 18th-19th century transitionary period from Spanish, and later Mexican control, to a nascent part of the United States. The findings include *fill in later w/ results, metrics, implications, etc*. The contribution of this thesis by creating a framework for discovering data in historical documents promotes and encourages continued innovation to the field of digital humanities. Future work involves *fill in once future work figured out*
